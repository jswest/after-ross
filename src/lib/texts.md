175 pounds of candy piled against a wall, a portrait of a dead lover, we are instructed to take a piece of it. The candy will be refilled endlessly, the work promises. The artist’s lover, Ross Laycock, died from AIDS-related complications the same year that the artist, Félix González-Torres, finished this piece, _Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)_.
	175 pounds, the description reads, corresponds to the average weight of an adult male—or, maybe, the ideal weight of Laycock.

Tired, excited, a fraternity pledge, Oliver Smoot, Jr., is lain again and again along the Harvard Bridge connecting Boston to Cambridge over the Charles River. It is night when Smoot’s brothers mark his body on the bridge in thick lines of paint 364 times. Eventually, Smoot is too tired to get up and lie back down, so his fellows carry him to each new position.

González-Torres measured a lover in candy. Lambda Chi Alpha measured a bridge in a man. I tell people I am a bisexual. These doomed human attempt to force the world to heel have no meaning outside what we give them. They are not the world.
	When I was younger, I learned the word, the measurement, _twink_. I am no longer a twink, whatever that means, in this autumn of my life, beard changing colors while I harvest the time spent in the fields of my twenties and thirties, body softening, expanding before the long winter ahead.

I sometimes wish I were a museum worker refilling the candy for _Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)_ endlessly, a Sisyphus who has found meaning in his task, carrying the weight of a man, an ideal man—though what is _ideal_ but another doomed human enterprise, another word we have to avoid describing the world as it is?
	González-Torres also died of complications from AIDS.
	I would gladly eat 175 pounds of candy.

After the Harvard bridge is rebuilt, the Cambridge police will miss Smoot’s measurements, and the Massachusetts Highway Department will mark the bridge’s concrete in smoots. Smoot, the man, will go on (you can’t make this up!) to chair the American National Standards Institute and the International Organization for Standardization. These organizations ensure our measurements mean the same thing no matter where they are used, another doomed attempt to force the world to heel.
	The smoot describes a bridge, a real bridge, but describing it in smoots changes what we make of it.
	I walk across the smoot bridge and note, with juvenile pleasure, that though they normally only mark every ten smoots, they painted 69, too (the sex number), and we all should break the rules—why not?—we made them, after all.

Desire fills me, animates me, demands to be seen, I want it to be seen, want it to be recognized, a fact that endlessly confounds me.

There was a body with an ideal weight of 175 pounds that was born into this world, lived and loved in this world, died in this world, died of a disease entwined with desire, of a disease so many wanted to ignore, and so González-Torres created a new unit of measurement: the Ross.
	When refilled, the candy needn’t be—and won’t be—in the same shape as before, though the mass will be the same, because that is what the Ross measures, not a shape of a person, but the weight of his absence.
	Candy disappears, sates the appetite of its devourer, but it will come back—it always comes back.

Walking home on the smoot bridge, I watch a man, shirtless, run toward me, sweat flowing over moving muscles, the sun golden this afternoon, the no-longer-summer sun, and my body buzzes and my mind statics with only the pleasure of my own gaze.
	He moves past one smoot, then another, then he’s past me, and I wish my desire were as legible as the paint on this bridge.

Galen, my partner, tells me what she wants, and though her desire is lost in the vibration of the language that traverses the air between us, though the words she says fail to capture her desire in its fullness, I can still, sometimes, miraculously, fulfill it.

A friend describes how she is trying to change her fantasies, to bring them in line with her political commitments, and maybe it will work for her, this taming of herself, but my desire has hugged itself so tightly around my mind that to remove it would be suicide. I describe my desire, through in my description—my measurement—it ceases be _mine_, ceases to be _desire_.

A few years ago, the Art Institute of Chicago, where I saw _Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)_, removed references to to AIDS and Laycock from the piece’s plaque. “The erasure of Ross's memory and Gonzalez-Torres's intent in the new description is an unconsciable [sic] and banal evil,” one tweet responded. The references were returned after the backlash.
	“It is crazy how Felix’s work continues to generate such meaningful and complex dialogue,” the head of the Felix González-Torres Foundation told _Artnet_. “Thank god!”
	Laycock and Gonález-Torres—that is to say, Ross and Félix—are gone, but the work still exists, endlessly refilled by our desirous attention, by our eyes hungry for meaning, by the taking of candy. We gorge on the numen the world offers our hunger, we gorge on the seething bounty it gives us, but it is never enough.

Before Smoot, Jorge Borges wrote a story, “On Exactitude in Science,” in which the world is drawn, uselessly, at a one-to-one scale. Later generation, realizing the early mapmakers’ folly, “delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters,” Borges writes. The map’s remains are still “inhabited by Animals and Beggars.”
	Measurement in the sun-bright awareness of its inevitable failure answers the question posed by Borges’s map and Smoot’s bridge because the world refuses to be seen in its absolute fidelity, in its true form. There is no point to describing the world as it is, no way to move through it in its perfect wholeness.

We participate in the construction of the world. We make it with our labels and measurements. Doesn’t this carry moral weight, the way we label and measure? Why wouldn’t morality give weight to our desires, too?
	Either she's deluding herself or she's deforming herself, I think sometimes about my friend who wants to reshape her fantasies.

I wonder, sometimes, at the fact of Ross Laycock—a real person. What does it mean to offer seventeen fragments for a person I never met?
	I do not know why González-Torres made _Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)_, but the blazing fact of its existence fills me, animates me. I choose to believe he made it so that we would think about the person named Ross Laycock—a real person—and what it means to eat candy for a person we never met. I almost cried when a friend reminded me that González-Torres was spreading Ross’s memory through acts of desire, that the taken candy inverted the contagion of AIDS. What would I want to spread if not desire?
	Now, I eat candy, and I think about Ross; I write this essay, and I think about Ross; I hope that is enough.

I want measurements that remystify the world, that surface the nest of snakes coiling and uncoiling just beneath the veneer of civilization. Like how from 1889 until 2019, the kilogram was defined by a hunk of metal housed in France, an object that was ever-so-slowly losing mass. From 1889 until 2019, didn’t people worry about the slow disintegration of the object that gave weight meaning? (And people say I’m the strange one for mistrusting measurements of desire!)
	Measurement is the world yanking the football away when we go to kick it.

When I was younger, I was worried I wasn’t a real writer; now, I know no one is a real writer because _real_ and _writer_ are more doomed words. These days, I worry I’m not a real bisexual, even though I know no one is.
	A friend asks if you’re a real bisexual when you’re actually having sex with a man and a woman simultaneously. “Maybe then,” I relent.

Some reduce desire to an instrument—for procreation, for pro-sociality, for self-empowerment—but I’ve decided desire is for desire. If we are called to be human, then we are called to desire. If we are called to be human, then we must pick the candy from the pile, feel the sweetness on our tongues, think of Ross.
